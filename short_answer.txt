1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?

 A client is a device or application that requests services or resources from a server. In the HTTP
 protocol, the client sends HTTP requests to the server.

 A server is a computer or system that provides services or resources to clients. It listens for
 incoming requests, processes them, and sends back responses. In the HTTP protocol, the server 
 receives the client's request, processes it, and sends back an HTTP response.

2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?

 A "route" on a server refers to a path or endpoint associated with a specific functionality or resource.
 e.g. /shoes, /api/404
